Sleep and Cardiovascular Metrics Exploration and Classification Project 🌜📈🏥
Dataset Overview 📊
The provided synthetic dataset, named "Healthdatapro," encompasses sleep and cardiovascular metrics, as well as lifestyle factors for approximately 400 fictive individuals. The main file, data.csv, incorporates essential columns:

Person ID 🆔
Gender ♀♂
Age 🎂
Occupation 👩‍⚕️👨‍💻
Sleep Duration ⏰: Average daily hours of sleep
Quality of Sleep 🌙: Subjective rating on a 1-10 scale
Physical Activity Level 🏋️: Average daily minutes of physical activity
Stress Level 😓: Subjective rating on a 1-10 scale
BMI Category 📏
Blood Pressure 💓: Systolic over diastolic pressure
Heart Rate ❤️: Beats per minute
Daily Steps 👣
Sleep Disorder 😴: Categorized as None, Insomnia, or Sleep Apnea
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
Key Questions ❓
Factors Contributing to Sleep Disorders:

Explore which factors might contribute to the presence of sleep disorders.
Investigate relationships between variables such as stress level, age, and physical activity.
Impact of Physical Activity on Sleep Quality:

Analyze if an increased level of physical activity correlates with better sleep quality.
Utilize scatter plots or regression analysis to visualize this relationship.
Effect of Sleep Disorder on Subjective Sleep Quality:

Investigate whether the presence of a sleep disorder affects the subjective sleep quality metric.
Conduct a comparative analysis or statistical test for insights.
Visualization Ideas 📈
Boxplot by Occupation 📊:
Illustrate the distribution of sleep duration or quality of sleep for each occupation.
Identify patterns and differences among various professions.
Scenario: Sleep Disorder Classification 🛌🚀
Background 🌐
As a professional in a health insurance company, your task is to create a classifier that predicts whether a potential client is likely to have a sleep disorder. This information will be utilized to determine the appropriate insurance premium for the client.

Objective 🎯
Construct a robust classifier based on the available dataset to predict the presence of a sleep disorder using features such as age, gender, occupation, sleep duration, and more.

Project Steps 📝
Data Preprocessing 🧹:

Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🕵️:

Further explore the dataset to understand relationships and patterns aiding in the classification task.
Feature Selection 🎯:

Identify the most relevant features for the classification model.
Utilize techniques such as feature importance or correlation analysis.
Model Development 🤖:

Choose a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest).
Train the model on the dataset.
Model Evaluation 📊:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Utilize cross-validation for robustness.
Deployment 🚀:

Deploy the model for real-time predictions if performance is satisfactory.
Iterate on the model and feature selection steps if needed.
